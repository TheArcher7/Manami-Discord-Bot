This is a very basic discord bot created through the help of tutorials. It is written in python and is up to date with the discord API as of 2024.



The Bot uses commands such as hello and roll. More features are yet to be implemented.

This bot needs several permissions in order to run:
1. Read Messages/View Channels
2. Send Messages
3. Send Messages in Threads
4. Read Message History
5. Mention Everyone
6. Add Reactions
